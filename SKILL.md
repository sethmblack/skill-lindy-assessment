# Lindy Assessment

Evaluate ideas, technologies, practices, books, or investments based on their survival time to predict future robustness and inform decisions.

---

## When to Use

- Choosing between old and new approaches, technologies, or ideas
- Evaluating books, courses, or learning investments
- Assessing the durability of business practices or strategies
- Deciding whether to adopt novel vs. established methods
- Request for "Lindy test" or "what does Lindy say?"
- When someone is chasing the new when the old is proven

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The item to evaluate (idea, technology, book, practice, etc.) |
| age | No | How long it has existed (will be researched if not provided) |
| alternatives | No | Competing options for comparison |
| context | No | The decision or situation where this will be applied |

---

## The Lindy Effect

**Core principle:** For non-perishable things, life expectancy is proportional to current age.

- A book in print for 40 years will likely be in print for another 40
- A technology used for 100 years will likely be used for another 100
- An idea that survived 2,000 years will likely survive another 2,000

**Why it works:** Time is the ultimate filter. Things that survive are hinting "ex post" that they have robustness. The only effective judge is time.

### What Lindy Applies To

| Applies To | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Ideas and concepts | Stoicism, democracy, compound interest |
| Technologies | Wheels, writing, fire |
| Practices | Fasting, walking, meditation |
| Books | Classics, religious texts, foundational works |
| Institutions | Universities, religions, governments |
| Skills | Reading, arithmetic, rhetoric |

### What Lindy Does NOT Apply To

| Does Not Apply To | Why |
|-------------------|-----|
| Perishable things | Humans, individual companies, biological organisms have natural lifespans |
| Things with hard expiration | Contracts, leases, patents |
| Things being artificially propped up | Subsidized industries, protected monopolies |
| Things in their death spiral | Newspapers, some retail formats |

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Determine Lindy Applicability

Is this subject:
- Non-perishable? (ideas, technologies, practices vs. organisms, contracts)
- Not artificially sustained? (surviving on merit vs. subsidized/protected)
- Free to be replaced? (competitors can emerge)

If NO to any: Lindy effect does not apply. Use other assessment methods.

### Step 2: Establish Age

- How long has this existed in roughly its current form?
- What is the earliest evidence of its use?
- Has it survived significant challenges/competition?

### Step 3: Calculate Lindy Expectancy

**Simple rule:** Expected remaining life = Current age

| Current Age | Expected Remaining Life |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 10 years | ~10 more years |
| 100 years | ~100 more years |
| 1,000 years | ~1,000 more years |

**Confidence increases with age:** A 10-year survival could be luck; a 1,000-year survival is robust evidence.

### Step 4: Compare Alternatives

For each competing option:
- What is its Lindy score?
- What has survived longest in this category?
- What is the Lindy ratio? (oldest option / newest option)

### Step 5: Apply to Decision

Consider:
- How long do you need this to remain relevant?
- What is the cost of wrong prediction?
- Is the new option compelling enough to overcome Lindy disadvantage?

### Step 6: Generate Recommendation

Integrate Lindy assessment with practical factors:
- Lindy-compatible options preferred for durable decisions
- Novel options acceptable for short-term, reversible, or experimental use
- High-stakes decisions strongly favor Lindy

## The Lindy Hierarchy

When choosing between options, prefer:

```
MOST PREFERRED
    |
Ancient (1000+ years)     — Highest confidence
    |
Old (100-1000 years)      — High confidence
    |
Established (50-100 years) — Moderate confidence
    |
Mature (20-50 years)      — Some evidence
    |
Young (5-20 years)        — Weak evidence
    |
Novel (<5 years)          — No Lindy evidence
    |
LEAST PREFERRED
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not apply Lindy to perishable things
- Age alone is not sufficient—must be survival under competition
- Lindy is a heuristic, not a law—exceptions exist
- Novel things are not automatically bad—but require stronger justification
- Consider whether artificial factors are propping up survival

**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Lindy Assessment

### Subject
Programming language choice for long-term career value

### Lindy Applicability
**Applies:** Yes (with caveats)
**Reasoning:** Programming languages are non-perishable ideas/tools that compete freely. However, the technology landscape shifts faster than many domains—50-year-old languages exist but aren't guaranteed another 50. Apply Lindy with calibrated expectations.

### Age Analysis

| Option | Age | Lindy Category | Expected Remaining Life |
|--------|-----|----------------|------------------------|
| Python | ~33 years (1991) | Mature | ~33 years |
| Go | ~14 years (2012) | Young | ~14 years |
| Rust | ~10 years (2015) | Young | ~10 years |
| C (for comparison) | ~52 years (1972) | Established | ~52 years |
| JavaScript | ~30 years (1995) | Mature | ~30 years |
| SQL | ~50 years (1974) | Established | ~50 years |

### Survival Evidence

**Python:**
- Survived the web revolution (adapted)
- Survived mobile revolution (remained relevant in backend/data)
- Survived AI/ML wave (became dominant)
- Outlasted: Perl, PHP (in many domains), Ruby (in growth)
- 30+ years of continuous growth is strong Lindy signal

**Go:**
- Created by Google; survived initial hype cycle
- Adopted for infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes)
- 14 years; meaningful but limited evidence
- Has not yet faced a major paradigm shift

**Rust:**
- 10 years; strong community momentum
- Systems programming niche; Mozilla origin survived Mozilla's decline
- Too young to have meaningful Lindy evidence
- Could be the next C++ or the next D (remember D?)

### Comparison

| Factor | Python | Go | Rust |
|--------|--------|-----|------|
| Age | 33 years | 14 years | 10 years |
| Lindy confidence | Moderate-High | Low-Moderate | Low |
| Major challenges survived | 3+ paradigm shifts | 1 cycle | None yet |
| Corporate dependency | Low (community-driven) | Medium (Google) | Low (community-driven) |
| Breadth of use | Very high | Medium | Growing |

### Decision Context

**Time horizon needed:** "Long-term career value" = 20-30 years
**Reversibility:** High—learning another language is costly but doable
**Cost of wrong choice:** Years of investment in potentially obsolete skills

For a 20-30 year horizon, you're asking: "What will still matter in 2050?"

### Recommendation

**Lindy verdict:** Prefer Python; Rust acceptable as secondary bet

**Reasoning:**

Python has the strongest Lindy signal of your options. 33 years, multiple paradigm survivals, and increasing—not decreasing—relevance. The "Python is slow" criticism has existed for 20 years; Python keeps winning.

But here's the Taleb twist: **Don't think about this as picking one language.**

**Barbell it:**
- **Safe end (80% of learning time):** Python—Lindy-proven, broad applicability, will not be wasted regardless of future
- **Speculative end (20% of learning time):** Rust—potentially transformative, bounded downside (if it fades, you learned systems thinking)
- **Avoid the middle:** Go is fine but doesn't have Python's Lindy or Rust's asymmetric upside

**What Lindy really says:** Learn the meta-skills that predate any language—algorithms (60+ years), data structures (50+ years), systems thinking (timeless). These are maximally Lindy. Languages are implementations; the ideas are eternal.

### The Bottom Line

Rust has 10 years of hype; Python has 33 years of survival. Your career is 40 years. Do the math. Learn Python deeply, dabble in Rust for optionality, and remember that SQL (50 years) and the ability to write clearly (5,000 years) will outlast both.
